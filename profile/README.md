# Astra Nova

The end was just the beginning.

## The Five Worlds

The Five Worlds lie in ruin, casualties of a celestial war between order and chaos. The Day of Destruction claimed many lives—but there were some who survived. Those brave enough to enter the ancient gateways were transported to the last bastion of hope in the universe: Astra Nova.

## The Deviants

The Deviants are the first inhabitants of Astra Nova. They're perfect genetic replicants of the 15 species of the Five Worlds, created to test the habitability of AstraNova. But to account for every possibility, the creators packed these mischievous miniatures with thousands of genetic deviations—and got much more than they bargained for.

There are 10,000 unique Deviant non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that will reside on the Ethereum network. Each Deviant offers a first glimpse into the worlds of Astra Nova and unlocks exclusive lore and in-game features.
